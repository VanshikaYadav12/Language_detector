# Language_detector
 This Language Detection Project is a task aimed at automatically identifying the language of a given piece of text. This is a key component in various natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as content localization, data preprocessing, automatic translation, and sentiment analysis. The goal is to develop a system or model that can take text input in multiple languages and accurately predict the language it is written in.
Libraries used in this project are:
 NumPy: For efficient numerical operations on arrays and matrices, useful in feature extraction and text manipulation.

Pandas: For managing and processing text data, including cleaning, organizing, and feature engineering.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks, such as text vectorization, classification, model training, and evaluation.
